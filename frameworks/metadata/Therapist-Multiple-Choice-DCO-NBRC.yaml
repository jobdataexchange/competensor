framework_name: "Registered Respiratory Therapist"
framework_description: "The RRT credential is nationally recognized as the “standard of excellence” for respiratory care professionals.\n\nThe examinations for the RRT credential objectively and uniformly measure essential knowledge, skills and abilities required of advanced respiratory therapists. The NBRC evaluates the competency of respiratory therapists and ensures that graduates of accredited respiratory care education programs have every opportunity to earn the RRT credential. It is in high demand nationwide, and we work diligently to help to fill the shortage of qualified respiratory therapists in the field.\n\nThe first examination for earning the RRT is the Therapist Multiple-Choice (TMC) Examination (prior to January 2015, it was known as the Written Registry Examination). The TMC Examination evaluates the abilities required of respiratory therapists at entry into practice and determines eligibility for the Clinical Simulation Examination (CSE). The CRT and/or RRT credentials are used as the basis for the licensure in all 49 states that regulate the practice of respiratory care.\n "
