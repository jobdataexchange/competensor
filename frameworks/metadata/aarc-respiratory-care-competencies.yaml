framework_description: "Competencies for Entry into Respiratory Therapy Practice \n \nExecutive Summary \n \nIn 2015, the Taskforce on Competencies for Entry into Respiratory Therapy Practice was charged with using data from the 2015 and Beyond conferences, and later sub-groups, to determine the competencies needed by respiratory care practitioners who are entering into respiratory care professional practice. Members of the taskforce included representatives from the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC), Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care, and National Board for Respiratory Care, along with liaisons from the three entities that were non-voting members. The taskforce reported an analysis and evaluation of all competencies and when these competencies should be acquired, either before or after entry into professional practice, as determined by the taskforce. The AARC Board of Directors approved this report in October 2016.\n "
